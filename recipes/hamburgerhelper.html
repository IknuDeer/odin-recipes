        <p>This homemade hamburger helper is far better than the boxed mix. With fresh spices, and a hint of tomato,
            it's beefy, cheesy, savory, and has all of the makings of a weeknight family favorite.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
