# odin-recipes

A basic HTML website project containing many recipes, done for The Odin Project.

While building this website I will need to demonstate my skills in:
- Building an html boilerplate
- Using different types of elements, such as paragraphs, headers or images
- Use attributes to add meaning to elements, such as href, src and alt
- Organizing the file structure of the website
